Summer Camp

The first fact we are given is that Blake likes to keep his feet on the ground at all times.
None of the ativities except for cooking involves that, so Blake likes cooking.
Oliver is afraid of heights, and the only activites that don't involve heights are cooking and kayaking.
Which means kayaking would be his favorite.
Abigail's favorite activity is not rock climbing, so he favorite has to be her only option, zip-lining.
Leaving Rosa with Rock Climbing (which does involve a harness, so it checks out)
