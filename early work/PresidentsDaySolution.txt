Presidents Day

We are given Milliard's birthday is on Thursday
John is 2 days older than Abe, so Abe cant be Tuesday or Monday
(or else John's birthday would be on a weekend, which is false)
Abe's birthday cannot be on Friday because William's is after Abe's
So Abe has to be Wednesday
William has to be Friday because it is after Abes, and Thurday is taken
John is on Monday because he is 2 days older than Abe
Which leaves George for Tuesday

Monday: John
Tuesday: George
Wednesday: Abe
Thrusday: Milliard
Friday: William
