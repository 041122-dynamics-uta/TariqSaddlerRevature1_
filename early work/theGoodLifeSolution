The Good Life

Bullets 1 and 4 give us fact number 1.
Since Pepper is playing catch or burying a chew toy, and a dog not named after a spice
is playing catch, that leaves Pepper with only burying a chew toy.

Since we know Bear is getting some exercise, the only 2 activities that involve exercise
are catch and walk, and bullet 2 says Bear is not on a walk, that means bear has to be playing catch

Now no other dog but Nutmeg can possibly be on a walk because Pepper is playing catch and it is specified
Ginger, Saber, and Bear cannot be walking.

Since only a spice-dog can get its ears scratched, and the other 2 spice-dogs have been determined,
that means Ginger has to be the one getting their ears scratched

Which leaves Saber with taking a nap
