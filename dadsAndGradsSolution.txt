Dads and Grads

Starting off, we can assume Stephanie is a graduate since that is the name of a female
Since the first bullet says "Micheal's son," we can assume Micheal is a father
Elias and James are both graduates because they both played on the baseball team
This would leave Alberto and Ken to be fathers. Putting the list, thus far, to look like this:
>Fathers: Micheal, Ken, Alberto
>Grad: Stephanie, Elias, James
(No matches yet)


Since Micheal has a son and he's not related to Elias, his son has to be James
Since Alberto can only be related to James or Elias, and it's not James, it must be Elias
Which leaves Ken with Stephanie
