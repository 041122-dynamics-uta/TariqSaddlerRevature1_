Allergy Season

Allegra: Shelfish
Clara: Nuts
Ben: Bee sting
Zach: Cats
Flora: Pollen


Since Flora's allergies are seasonal, it must be pollen
Since Clara's is not related to animals, the only allergy left for her would be nuts
Since Allegra's allergies has to do with food, and Nuts is taken, Shellfish is her allergy
This leaves Ben with only bee stings since he's not allergic to cats.
Leaving Zach with the last allergy: Cats
